                        This week I found another article related to my research. The paper is about predicting food 
                        demand in food courts by decision tree approaches. From an economic point of view, preparing 
                        the wrong amount of food creates economic problems. If the supply exceeds the demand it leads 
                        to food waste and companies that make food lose their money and resources. On the other hand, 
                        if the demand is higher than the supply of food, the restaurant may lose their customer and 
                        prestige. Having a computer program that can predict the amount of food can benefit food suppliers 
                        in many ways. The research uses data mining and tree decision methods to predict the demand for food. 
                        Data mining is discovering the relationship, correlations, and trends in data with the help of 
                        algorithms. Data mining consists of various techniques such as neural networks, statistics, 
                        decision trees, and genetic algorithms. In the research, to study food demand the researchers 
                        collected the input data such as seasonal demand change, holidays along with the number of food 
                        consumed each day. Three different decision tree algorithms (CART, CHAID, and Mircosoft 
                        Decision Trees) are implemented to predict menu-based food consumption in a university 
                        food court. The decision tree is a data mining technique usually used for classification and 
                        prediction. The authors choose a decision tree in their research because it is an easily 
                        understandable and interpretable model, quick to build, and adaptable to data change. 
                        Moreover, decision tree methods also have high precision accuracy, so it is a trustable 
                        choice for this project. The main two tools they used in this project are SPSS Clementine 
                        and Microsoft Analysis Service.

                    The research focuses on a forecasting approach that is based on the data from the point-of-sale systems and allows for a 
                    straightforward human interpretation. The research aimed to predict the daily sold of the item in a menu based restaurant. 
                    Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for success in restaurant and dinning hall management. For the environment aspect, 
                    predicting food demand helps reduce food waste and contribute greatly to sustainable development. Moreover, having a correct 
                    amount of food to prepare will increase the profit of the restaurants. For the method, the authors used two Bayesian 
                    generalized additive models (GAMs) for predicting demand. The first model assumes a normally distributed target and 
                    the second assumes the response follows a negative binomial distribution. The outcome of the research is that both models 
                    provide a reasonable fit for the time series data. My intended project is about predicting food demand in a restaurant, 
                    it is the same idea with this article. This research used the data from a restaurant point of sales system. 
                    In my future research, I may include more data such as weather forecast, seasons and also weekdays in the data to 
                    generate the food demand prediction.

                        The second article talks about food demand prediction using the nonlinear autoregressive exogenous neutral network. 
                        This is the link to the article: article 2. Food demand prediction is an important issue to both business and 
                        sustainable development. Predicting accurate food demand can reduce the business operation cost by reducing 
                        inventory fee and increasing customer satisfaction. For the environment issue, food waste and loss have been 
                        the topic draw much attention in recent years. Data shows that 1.3 tons of food is waste each year, approximately 
                        one third of the food produced. In the supply food chain, the food waste in the consumption phase is the largest 
                        about 40% to 60%. Modern food system should be designed to prevent overproduction, over-abundance and waste. 
                        Compared to the qualitative prediction method, the quantitative method involving data and statistic method has a 
                        better performance. There are different predicting models have been used before, this research used the nonlinear 
                        autoregressive exogenous neural network (NARXNN) for food demand prediction. In this research, the authors train 
                        the neural network topologies and then simulated it for demand prediction. Therefore, two dataset were used: one 
                        for training process and one for testing the prediction. The result of the study is that NARX model based on 
                        artificial intelligence can create highly accurate food demand forecast. The nonlinear autoregressive exogenous 
                        and neural network is an effective method for time series predicting model. This research is closely related to 
                        what I wanted to do. In the future, I want to study more about the method they use in this research and apply it 
                        to my senior project.

                <p class="about-text">
                    For this week, I continue to search for new papers to fill my research gap. I plan to develop a machine learning model 
                    to predict food demand in menu-based restaurants. I have conducted some research to identify the best algorithm for my 
                    intended project and have found various approaches used by other researchers, such as decision trees, artificial neural 
                    networks, Bayesian approaches, and nonlinear autoregressive exogenous neural networks. My plan is to optimize the chosen 
                    algorithm to generate the best outcome.

                    To ensure the feasibility of my project, I have read relevant literature, which has helped me understand machine learning 
                    terminologies and methods, including artificial neural networks and particle swarm optimization algorithms. According to 
                    the paper I have read, artificial neutral network (ANNs) is an information processing system that imitating the human biological 
                    brain neural network. The benefit of using ANN is its learning capabilities. In the recent time, there are a lot of models developed
                    by applying ANN because of its characteristics such as high-speed computing, fast recall, high learning accuracy and fault tolerance. 
                    Training ANN model is a procedure which ANN processes a set of input-output data repeatedly. To improve the performance of the model, 
                    the values of weighting factors change according to the predetermined algorithms.
                    
                    Some key questions that I need to address are the potential input-output data, where to find the data, the steps to undertake the 
                    machine learning project, the best model for food prediction, and how to calculate the result. I plan to answer these questions by 
                    conducting further research online, extracting useful information from relevant articles, and seeking basic tutorials to learn about 
                    key concepts. I also intend to undertake small projects related to my intended project to gain a better understanding of the topic. 
                    I think it is important to conduct thorough research and gaining a good understanding of machine learning concepts and methods before 
                    beginning my senior comp.
