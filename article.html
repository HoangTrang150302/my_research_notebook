                    The study has the same topic with my intended project. I want to do research about food waste in the 
                    college dinning hall or specific station. This research shows me the essential parts of the paper I 
                    need to write and the process to do a data science and machine learning project 
                    (collecting data, developing model, result).

                        This week I found another article related to my research. The paper is about predicting food 
                        demand in food courts by decision tree approaches. From an economic point of view, preparing 
                        the wrong amount of food creates economic problems. If the supply exceeds the demand it leads 
                        to food waste and companies that make food lose their money and resources. On the other hand, 
                        if the demand is higher than the supply of food, the restaurant may lose their customer and 
                        prestige. Having a computer program that can predict the amount of food can benefit food suppliers 
                        in many ways. The research uses data mining and tree decision methods to predict the demand for food. 
                        Data mining is discovering the relationship, correlations, and trends in data with the help of 
                        algorithms. Data mining consists of various techniques such as neural networks, statistics, 
                        decision trees, and genetic algorithms. In the research, to study food demand the researchers 
                        collected the input data such as seasonal demand change, holidays along with the number of food 
                        consumed each day. Three different decision tree algorithms (CART, CHAID, and Mircosoft 
                        Decision Trees) are implemented to predict menu-based food consumption in a university 
                        food court. The decision tree is a data mining technique usually used for classification and 
                        prediction. The authors choose a decision tree in their research because it is an easily 
                        understandable and interpretable model, quick to build, and adaptable to data change. 
                        Moreover, decision tree methods also have high precision accuracy, so it is a trustable 
                        choice for this project. The main two tools they used in this project are SPSS Clementine 
                        and Microsoft Analysis Service.

                    This is the link to the research article: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207021001011. 
                    The research focuses on a forecasting approach that is based on the data from the point-of-sale systems and allows for a 
                    straightforward human interpretation. The research aimed to predict the daily sold of the item in a menu based restaurant. 
                    Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for success in restaurant and dinning hall management. For the environment aspect, 
                    predicting food demand helps reduce food waste and contribute greatly to sustainable development. Moreover, having a correct 
                    amount of food to prepare will increase the profit of the restaurants. For the method, the authors used two Bayesian 
                    generalized additive models (GAMs) for predicting demand. The first model assumes a normally distributed target and 
                    the second assumes the response follows a negative binomial distribution. The outcome of the research is that both models 
                    provide a reasonable fit for the time series data. My intended project is about predicting food demand in a restaurant, 
                    it is the same idea with this article. This research used the data from a restaurant point of sales system. 
                    In my future research, I may include more data such as weather forecast, seasons and also weekdays in the data to 
                    generate the food demand prediction.
